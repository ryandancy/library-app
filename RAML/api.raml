      An object representing an item in the system. Items can be checked out and

      bibliographic information is specified through MARC records. Anything not
      in the `marc` property is information additional to MARC.

      An object representing an admin in the library. This could be a librarian,
      IT person, volunteer, or anyone who needs read or write access to the
      library. An admin has a set of permissions that correspond with OAuth
      scopes.
