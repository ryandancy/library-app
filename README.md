# Library App

A simple Node.js/AngularJS (eventually) webapp for the management of a school
(or maybe eventually other) library. Patrons do not check out items themselves;
instead, "admins" check out items for them.

Currently just a RESTful HTTP server, but will eventually include an AngularJS
frontend. Run `npm start` to run the server, or `npm test` to run all 100+
tests.
